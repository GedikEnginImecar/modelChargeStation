Project focusing on mechanical design and embedded systems & their code.

Overview of the project is to adapt the design of a real life EV charging station and equip it with custom electronics such as:
- speakers&dac
- esp32-s3 for ble control
- wireless charging pad
- usb hub
- hinge designs
- capacitive touch hmi displays
- 
to test what I can achieve and do in terms of mechanical design as well as making a more advanced system compared to my previous projects work in harmony
